2.10 pm: That's tea-time and India are in complete control. Kohli is in sight of a seventh double-century, which will make him India's highest double-centurion. When he gets to 200, he'll also get to 7000 Test runs. And before that, two more runs will make his tally level with Sir Don Bradman. Ravindra Jadeja has been pretty solid, playing like a proper No.6, and giving Kohli company. South Africa haven't posed much of a challenge so far, and you get the sense that all they can do is wait for the declaration. We'll be back for the final session shortly - don't go anywhere, not with Kohli near so many landmarks.
